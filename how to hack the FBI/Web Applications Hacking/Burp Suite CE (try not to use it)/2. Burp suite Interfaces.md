### What the interfaces in Burp Suite is about..
---

#### The Dashboard

>- **The Tasks** menu allows us to define background tasks that Burp Suite will run whilst we use the application. The Pro version would also allow us to create on-demand scans. The default "Live Passive Crawl" (which automatically logs the pages we visit) will be more than suitable for our uses in this module.
>
>- **The Event** log tells us what Burp Suite is doing (e.g. starting the Proxy), as well as information about any connections that we are making through Burp.
>
>- **The Issue Activity** section is exclusive to Burp Pro. It won't give us anything using Burp Community, but in Burp Professional it would list all of the vulnerabilities found by the automated scanner. These would be ranked by severity and filterable by how sure Burp is that the component is vulnerable.
>
>- **The Advisory** section gives more information about the vulnerabilities found, as well as references and suggested remediations. These could then be exported into a report.
