## Burp Proxy 
---

The Burp Proxy is the most fundamental (and most important!) of the tools available in Burp Suite.
It allows us to ***capture requests and responses*** between ourselves and our target. These can then be ***manipulated or sent to other tools for further processing*** before being allowed to continue to their destination.

P.S: Make sure to have your FoxyProxy browser add-on installed before using Proxy in Burp

Next, Add Proxy with the following details

> - Title: Burp (or anything else you prefer)
>- Proxy IP: 127.0.0.1
>- Port: 8080

To use Burp Proxy, enable the Proxy created from your browser. Then, all traffic will be redirected to the proxy IP configured in the settings.

### Proxying HTTPS

Fortunately, Burp offers us an easy way around this. We need to get Firefox to trust connections secured by Portswigger certs, so we will manually add the CA certificate to our list of trusted certificate authorities.

First, with the proxy activated head to http://burp/cert; this will download a file called cacert.der -- save it somewhere on your machine.

Next, type about:preferences into your Firefox search bar and press enter; this takes us to the FireFox settings page. Search the page for "certificates" and we find the option to "View Certificates":

Clicking the "View Certificates" button allows us to see all of our trusted CA certificates. We can register a new certificate for Portswigger by pressing "Import" and selecting the file that we just downloaded.

In the menu that pops up, select "Trust this CA to identify websites", then click Ok:
