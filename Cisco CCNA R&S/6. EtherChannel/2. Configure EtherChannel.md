### Configuration Guidelines

> -   **EtherChannel support** - All Ethernet interfaces must support EtherChannel with no requirement that interfaces be physically contiguous.
> -   **Speed and duplex** - Configure all interfaces in an EtherChannel to operate at the same speed and in the same duplex mode.
> -   **VLAN match** - All interfaces in the EtherChannel bundle must be assigned to the same VLAN or be configured as a trunk (shown in the figure).
> -   **Range of VLANs** - An EtherChannel supports the same allowed range of VLANs on all the interfaces in a trunking EtherChannel. If the allowed range of VLANs is not the same, the interfaces do not form an EtherChannel, even when they are set to **auto** or **desirable** mode.

The figure shows a configuration that would allow an EtherChannel to form between S1 and S2.==

In the next figure, S1 ports are configured as half duplex. Therefore, an EtherChannel will not form between S1 and S2.

a mode of communication especially with a computer via telephone line in which information can be sent in only one direction at a time

### LACP Configuration Example

EtherChannel is disabled by default and must be configured.
