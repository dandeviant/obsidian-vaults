Three directly connected IPv4 static routes are configured on R1 using the exit interface.

```Text
R1(config)# ip route 172.16.1.0 255.255.255.0 s0/1/0
R1(config)# ip route 192.168.1.0 255.255.255.0 s0/1/0
R1(config)# ip route 192.168.2.0 255.255.255.0 s0/1/0
``````

**Note**: Using a next-hop address is generally recommended. Directly connected static routes should only be used with point-to-point serial interfaces, as in this example.
