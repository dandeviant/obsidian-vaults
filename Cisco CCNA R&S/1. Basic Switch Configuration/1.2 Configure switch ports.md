Examine the auto-MDIX setting for a specific interface

 >```text
> S1# show controllers ethernet-controller fa0/1 phy | include MDIX 
> Auto-MDIX : On [AdminState=1 Flags=0x00052248]

| **Error Type** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Input Errors** | Total number of errors. It includes runts, giants, no buffer, CRC, frame, overrun, and ignored counts.
| **Runts** | Packets that are discarded because they are smaller than the minimum packet size for the medium. For instance, any Ethernet packet that is less than 64 bytes is considered a runt.
| **Giants** | Packets that are discarded because they exceed the maximum packet size for the medium. For example, any Ethernet packet that is greater than 1,518 bytes is considered a giant.
| **CRC** | CRC errors are generated when the calculated checksum is not the same as the checksum received.
| **Output Errors** | Sum of all errors that prevented the final transmission of datagrams out of the interface that is being examined.
| **Collisions** |Number of messages retransmitted because of an Ethernet collision.
| **Late Collisions** | A collision that occurs after 512 bits of the frame have been transmitted.
