 the example, three directly connected IPv6 static routes are configured on R1 using the exit interface.

```Text
R1(config)# ipv6 route 2001:db8:acad:1::/64 s0/1/0
R1(config)# ipv6 route 2001:db8:cafe:1::/64 s0/1/0
R1(config)# ipv6 route 2001:db8:cafe:2::/64 s0/1/0
```

**Note**: Using a next-hop address is generally recommended. Directly connected static routes should only be used with point-to-point serial interfaces, as in this example.
